💠 Sponsor & Compute Partnership Program
🚀 Join the Movement to Make Bharat AI-Self-Reliant

The Bharat Foundation Model Framework (BFMF) is a community-driven, open-source initiative dedicated to building India’s own sovereign foundation models — trained on Indian data, built with open technologies, and deployable on Indian infrastructure.

To make this mission sustainable and scalable, we invite institutions, startups, cloud providers, universities, and individuals to sponsor or contribute compute, data, or financial resources.

🤝 Ways to Support
Type	How You Can Help	Example Partners / Resources
💻 Compute Sponsorship	Provide GPU/TPU resources for training and fine-tuning Bharat models	ExoStack clusters, AWS/GCP credits, local GPU labs
📊 Data Contribution	Share open datasets (multilingual, governance, legal, medical, etc.) for Indian domains	IndicCorp, Government data, regional datasets
🧠 Research Collaboration	Co-develop model architectures, benchmarks, or LoRA fine-tunes	AI Institutes, Universities, Research Labs
🏦 Financial Sponsorship	Fund compute operations, dataset curation, or research teams	Corporates, CSR programs, Public/Private Grants
🧑‍💻 Community Contributions	Code, documentation, benchmarking, and localization	Developers, students, and AI enthusiasts
