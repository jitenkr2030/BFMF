## üìù **CONCLUSION**

The Bharat-FM framework has **good foundational training components** but requires **significant infrastructure improvements** to support large-scale, production-grade model training. The **8 identified gaps** represent essential capabilities for training state-of-the-art models:

1. **Advanced Distributed Training** (Critical)
2. **Automated Hyperparameter Optimization** (Critical)
3. **Neural Architecture Search** (High Priority)
4. **Advanced Model Parallelism** (High Priority)
5. **Training Data Management** (High Priority)
6. **Training Fault Tolerance** (Medium Priority)
7. **Training Resource Optimization** (Medium Priority)
8. **Training Validation & Testing** (Medium Priority)

With a **16-week implementation plan**, Bharat-FM can evolve from basic training capabilities to a **comprehensive, enterprise-grade training infrastructure** capable of training large-scale models efficiently and reliably.

**Recommendation**: **Start immediately with Advanced Distributed Training and Hyperparameter Optimization** as these are foundational for all other training capabilities and will provide immediate performance improvements.
