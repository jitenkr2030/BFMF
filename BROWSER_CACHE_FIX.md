# Browser Cache Fix Instructions

## 🚨 Issue Identified

The Z.ai logo is still showing due to **browser caching**. The new Bharat Foundation Model Framework logo has been successfully created and deployed, but your browser is showing the cached version.

## ✅ What Has Been Done

1. **Created New Logo**: ✅ `/public/logo.svg` with BFMF design
2. **Updated Code**: ✅ All references updated in `page.tsx` and `layout.tsx`
3. **Server Verification**: ✅ Confirmed new logo is being served correctly
4. **Cache Busting**: ✅ Added cache-busting techniques

## 🔧 How to Fix This

### **Immediate Solutions**

#### **Option 1: Hard Refresh (Recommended)**
- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + F5` or `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + R`
- **Chrome/Firefox/Edge**: This forces a full refresh without cache

#### **Option 2: Clear Browser Cache**
1. **Chrome**: 
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + Delete` (Mac)
   - Select "Cached images and files"
   - Click "Clear data"

2. **Firefox**:
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + Delete` (Mac)
   - Select "Cache"
   - Click "Clear Now"

3. **Edge**:
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + Delete` (Mac)
   - Select "Cached images and files"
   - Click "Clear"

#### **Option 3: Incognito/Private Mode**
- Open a new incognito/private window
- Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- This should show the new logo immediately

#### **Option 4: Developer Tools**
1. Right-click on the page and select "Inspect"
2. Go to the "Network" tab
3. Check "Disable cache"
4. Refresh the page with `F5`

## ✅ Verification Steps

After performing any of the above steps, you should see:

1. **New Logo Design**:
   - 🇮🇳 Ashoka Chakra (rotating wheel) in the center
   - 🎨 Indian tricolor colors (saffron, white, green)
   - 🔵 Navy blue elements
   - ⭐ Sovereign stars
   - 🤖 AI core pattern
   - 📱 "BFMF" text at the bottom

2. **Page Content**:
   - Title: "Bharat Foundation Model Framework"
   - Alt text: "Bharat Foundation Model Framework Logo"
   - No Z.ai references anywhere

## 🔍 Technical Verification

If you want to verify the changes technically:

1. **Check Logo Source**:
   ```bash
   curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3000/logo.svg | grep "Ashoka Chakra"
   ```
   Should return: `<!-- Ashoka Chakra (Indian Symbol) -->`

2. **Check Page Content**:
   ```bash
   curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3000/ | grep "Bharat Foundation Model Framework"
   ```
   Should return multiple matches

## 🚀 What the New Logo Represents

The new logo includes:
- **Ashoka Chakra**: India's national symbol with 24 spokes
- **Tricolor Gradient**: Official Indian flag colors
- **AI Core Pattern**: Neural network representation
- **Foundation Base**: Strong infrastructure symbol
- **Tech Circuits**: Modern digital connectivity
- **Sovereign Stars**: National pride elements

## 📞 If Issues Persist

If you still see the Z.ai logo after trying all the above:

1. **Restart Browser**: Completely close and reopen your browser
2. **Different Browser**: Try accessing the site in a different browser
3. **Restart Dev Server**: Stop and restart the development server
4. **Check Console**: Look for any errors in browser developer tools
